# Given two sorted arrays X and Y of size m and n each, merge the elements of X with elements of Y by maintaining the
# sorted order (fill X with the first m smallest elements and fill Y with remaining elements). This conversion should be
# done in-place and without using any other data structure.


def merge(array_x, array_y):
    # TODO
    pass


x = [1, 4, 7, 8, 10]
y = [2, 3, 9]

merge(x, y)
print('X: {}\nY: {}'.format(x, y))
